# SafeCall Guardian
## Description
This app allows the user to simulate receiving a phone call with a custom number to show the pretend caller. This app is intended for safety reasons by providing the user a potential escape from uncomfortable or dangerous situations. The app comes with a Settings page to let the user input a custom number they want to show up when the phone call comes through.  

This project was assigned by James Cook University (JCU) as part of my Bachelor of Information Technlogy degree during the first semester of my second year. 

## Development and Timeframe
This app was created using Android Studio so it's only capable of being used on Android devices. 

The areas I would like to add or improve on in the future are:
1. Convert the app to cross-platform to support both Android and iOS.
2. Find the correct device implementation that allows a custom name to show instead of a custom number. Either name or number could be chosen in the Settings page. 
3. Potentially incorporate the location of the device with Firebase when the call takes place to provide to authorities of locations where dangerous situations are occurring.
4. Improve the design. 

The timeframe it took for this app was 1 month. This time included creative-thinking, planning, designing, coding, troubleshooting and writing. 

## How to run
1. Open the app with Android Studio. 
2. Start the Android Emulator and run the app. 
3. Use the below credentials for admin access into the app.
4. There is a pre-set phone number to show up but this can be changed in the Settings page.
5. Choose a timeframe and select 'Schedule Call' and the phone call will come through once the timeframe has passed.
